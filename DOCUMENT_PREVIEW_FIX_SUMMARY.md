# Document Preview Fix Summary

## Issue
Users were encountering "Document Preview Unavailable - Server Error" when attempting to view documents, particularly when the frontend was hosted on GitHub Pages while the backend was on Koyeb.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **API URL Construction**: The `getFullApiUrl` function wasn't correctly handling paths that already included `/api` prefix when building the full Koyeb URL.
2. **Incorrect API Base URL**: The API_URL in config.ts included `/api` at the end, causing path duplication.
3. **Error Handling**: The error messages weren't user-friendly enough to guide users when preview failed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API URL Construction (client/src/lib/queryClient.ts)
- Completely rewrote the `getFullApiUrl` function to properly handle API paths
- Added better logic for constructing URLs based on environment (dev vs prod)
- Improved handling of paths that already contain `/api/` prefix
- Added more detailed logging for easier debugging

### 2. Updated API URL Configuration (client/src/config.ts)
- Modified the production API URL to use the base Koyeb URL without `/api` suffix
- This allows the `getFullApiUrl` function to handle path construction more reliably

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Preview.tsx**: Added more detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps
- **PdfViewer.tsx**: Improved error display to distinguish between connection issues and file parsing problems
- Added conditional messaging based on error types to guide users

### 4. Enhanced UI Experience
- Improved styling of error messages for better readability
- Added proper loading states during preview attempts
- Made buttons more distinctive in error states for better user guidance

### 5. Additional Debugging
- Added extensive console logging for better debugging
- Added environment information logging to track API URL construction

## Light Mode UI Enhancements
- Added specific light mode styling for text with pink/purple theme
- Improved light mode text readability with appropriate contrast
- Added consistent button and SVG icon styling for both light and dark modes
- Applied floating animation to both light and dark mode elements for consistency

## Testing Notes
- API URL construction has been verified with console logs
- Cross-domain authentication remains based on localStorage for GitHub Pages compatibility

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push these changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Pages workflow
2. The GitHub Pages deployment will automatically use the correct Koyeb backend URL
3. No changes are needed on the Koyeb backend deployment

This fix ensures reliable document preview functioning between the GitHub Pages frontend and Koyeb backend.
