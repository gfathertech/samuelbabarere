# Server-Side Koyeb Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and implementations made to ensure proper deployment of the backend API service to Koyeb.

## Key Fixes

1. **Fixed MongoDB Connection in Health Endpoint**
   - Added `mongoose` import to `server/routes.ts` to properly check database connection status
   - Implemented connection state checking via `mongoose.connection.readyState`

2. **Optimized Koyeb Entry Point**
   - The `server/koyeb.ts` file has been configured as a standalone API entry point
   - Does not rely on client files, making it perfect for dedicated API hosting

3. **Verified Build Process**
   - Successfully tested the `npm run build:koyeb` command
   - Confirmed proper generation of `dist/koyeb.js` output file (30.2KB)
   - Build configuration correctly bundles all necessary server code

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Enhanced cross-origin handling for GitHub Pages frontend communication
   - Set proper CORS headers with `sameSite: 'none'` for cross-domain cookies

5. **Authentication Improvements**
   - Modified cookie settings to support cross-domain authentication
   - Added fallback to localStorage-based authentication for GitHub Pages

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the server to Koyeb:

1. Ensure your MongoDB connection string is set in the environment variables
2. Run `npm run build:koyeb` to generate the distribution files
3. Deploy the `/server/dist` folder to Koyeb
4. Set the entry point to `koyeb.js`
5. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
   - `PORT`: Usually automatically set by Koyeb, but can be specified if needed

## Testing the Deployment

To verify the API is working correctly:

1. Check the health endpoint: `https://your-koyeb-app.koyeb.app/api/health`
2. Expected response: 
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "timestamp": "2023-xx-xxTxx:xx:xx.xxxZ",
     "environment": "production",
     "mongodb": "connected"
   }
   ```

## Notes for Frontend Integration

After deploying the backend to Koyeb:

1. Update the API URL in `client/src/config.ts` to point to your Koyeb URL
2. No other server-side changes should be needed
