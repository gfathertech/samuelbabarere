# Koyeb Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When trying to deploy the backend to Koyeb, the build process failed with:
```
esbuild index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
âœ˜ [ERROR] Could not resolve "../client/vite.config"
```

The issue was that the server code was trying to import the client Vite configuration, but in the Koyeb deployment environment, the client directory doesn't exist.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created a separate entry point for Koyeb deployment**:
   - Created `server/koyeb.ts` that doesn't depend on client Vite configuration
   - This file includes all necessary server functionality but excludes Vite setup

2. **Added dedicated build and start scripts**:
   - Added `build:koyeb` script in server/package.json
   - Added `start:koyeb` script to run the Koyeb-specific build

3. **Detailed documentation**:
   - Created `server/KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Created `client/koyeb-fix.md` with technical details about the fix
   - Updated `server/README.md` with Koyeb deployment information

## How to Deploy to Koyeb

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create a new service on Koyeb
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Set the build command to: `npm run build:koyeb`
5. Set the start command to: `npm run start:koyeb`
6. Add all necessary environment variables (MONGODB_URI, etc.)
7. Deploy!

## Architecture Overview

The application now uses a clear separation between development and production environments:

- **Development**: Full-stack setup with Vite for frontend development
- **Production**: 
  - API-only backend on Koyeb
  - Static frontend on GitHub Pages

This separation makes deployment simpler and more reliable while allowing independent scaling of frontend and backend.
