# Koyeb Deployment Fix

## The Problem

When attempting to deploy the backend to Koyeb, we encountered an issue where the build process was failing with the following error:

```
esbuild index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
âœ˜ [ERROR] Could not resolve "../client/vite.config"
```

The root cause was that our server code depended on the client's Vite configuration (`../client/vite.config.ts`), but in a Koyeb deployment, the client directory is not available.

## The Solution

### 1. Created A Separate Entry Point

We created `server/koyeb.ts` as a dedicated entry point for Koyeb deployment. This file:

- Includes all necessary server functionality
- Does not import or depend on any client-side code or configuration
- Uses a simplified approach that focuses only on the API functionality

### 2. Configured Build Scripts

We updated the `package.json` in the server directory with:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:koyeb": "esbuild koyeb.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
  "start:koyeb": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/koyeb.js"
}
```

These scripts compile the `koyeb.ts` file into a standalone bundle that can be deployed without any client dependencies.

### 3. Provided Deployment Guidelines

We created comprehensive deployment documentation to guide you through the process:
- `server/KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- `KOYEB_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical explanation of the fix implementation

## Testing the Solution

The solution was tested locally by:
1. Building with `npm run build:koyeb`
2. Verifying the output in the `dist` directory
3. Ensuring all client-side dependencies were removed

## Next Steps

When deploying to Koyeb:
1. Use the `npm run build:koyeb` command for building
2. Use the `npm run start:koyeb` command for running
3. Remember to set all necessary environment variables

By using this approach, the server can be deployed independently from the client, allowing for a clear separation between the frontend (on GitHub Pages) and the backend API (on Koyeb).
